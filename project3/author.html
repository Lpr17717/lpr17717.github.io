            <div> <p> F. Scott Fitzgerald was
              born in St. Paul, Minnesota,
              in 1896. He attended Princeton University,
              joined the United States Army during World War
              I, and published his first novel, This Side of
              Paradise, in 1920. That same year he married
              Zelda Sayre and for the next decade the couple
              lived in New York, Paris, and on the Riviera.
              Fitzgerald’s masterpieces include The Beautiful
              and Damned, The Great Gatsby, and Tender Is the
              Night. He died at the age of forty-four while
              working on The Last Tycoon. Fitzgerald’s
              fiction has secured his reputation as one
              of the most important American writers of
              the twentieth century. </p></div>
