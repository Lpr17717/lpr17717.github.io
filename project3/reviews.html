            <p>THE GREAT GATSBY is an American classic
              and a wonderfully evocative work. Like
              much of Fitzgerald's prose, it is neat
              and well-crafted. Fitzgerald has a
              brilliant understanding of lives that
              are corrupted by greed and turn out
              incredibly sad and unfulfilled.

            THE GREAT GATSBY is a magnificent novel
            on every level. Fitzgerald writes about
            the Jazz Age in language that beautifully
            evokes music. He writes about a hot day in
            a way that almost makes you sweat. His
            characters are well-drawn, and the plot
            is engaging and fast-paced. Though this
            novel is possibly best appreciated by
            college-level readers, advanced high
            school students will find a lot to
            enjoy and discuss.
