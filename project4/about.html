      <div><h2>About</h2>
    <p>The fruits and flowers could be purchased as snacks, ingredients, or edible decorations. In the market of today, so much of what we eat is processed. This of course allows us to experience all kinds of foods from around the world, but often sacrifices healthiness. This has led many people to turn back to local goods. For some people though, healthier living means giving up things they really enjoy, like sweets. The hope of this business is to offer a healthier alternative to highly processed mainstream candy.

        • Promote healthy eating, especially for people with a sweet tooth 
        • Buy product locally as much as possible to support farms in the area
        • Provide a relaxing and fun shopping experience for customers</p></div>
