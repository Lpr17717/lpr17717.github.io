  <h2>About</h2>
      <div id="about">
      <p>The fruits and flowers could be purchased as
        snacks, ingredients, or edible decorations.
        In the market of today, so much of what we
        eat is processed. This of course allows us
        to experience all kinds of foods from around
        the world, but often sacrifices healthiness.
        This has led many people to turn back to local
        goods. For some people though, healthier living
        means giving up things they really enjoy,
        like sweets. The hope of this business is
        to offer a healthier alternative to highly
        processed mainstream candy.

        <li class="aboutlist">Promote healthy eating, especially for people with a sweet tooth</li>
        <li class="aboutlist">Provide a relaxing and fun shopping experience for customers</li>
        <li class="aboutlist">Buy product locally as much as possible to support farms in the area</li>
